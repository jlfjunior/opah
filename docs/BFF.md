# Backend for Frontend
Backend for Frontend (BFF) is an intermediate layer that orchestrates the interaction between the user interface (frontend) and the Transaction Management and Daily Balance Consolidation systems. The BFF offers a simplified and optimized interface for the frontend and ensures that interactions with the transaction and financial reporting systems are carried out efficiently and securely.

This system acts as a single point of entry for transaction data, consolidated balances and financial reports, abstracting away the complexities of the underlying systems and providing ready-to-use data via the user interface.
